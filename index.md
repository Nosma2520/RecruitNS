## Welcome to RecruitNS

RecruitNS is an open source project that was started in July 2020. It was designed with user convenience in mind and the fact that a large number of regions in NationStates use Discord for most of their official business. Now API recruitment is something they can add to that list with only one simple command.

### Command
```
&recruit {Client Key} {Telegram ID} {Secret Key} {Your NationStates Nation} {# of Telegrams} {Your Region}
```
For your NS nation and NS region enter it as all lowercase and use underscores to replace spaces.

Ex. 
```
&recruit a0000p0i 1234567 a11111a1111 example_nation 100000 test_region 
```
### Advantages & Disadvantages
<b>Advantages</b>
- No Download
- No need to keep your device on for the duration of the campaign
- Controlled by one command
- Deletes command before starting the recruit campaign 

<b>Disadvantages</b>
- Requires its own dedicated channel
